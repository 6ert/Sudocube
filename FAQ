Q: I don't see any numbers on the cubes after starting a new game.
A: Please check 'images' path is found by Sudocube.

Check it in the head of the 'Tools' - Sudocube tab - menu
e.g. Image Path
'C:\Users\root\Documents\images'
In script mode 'images' folder should be located where the script 'Sudocube.py' resides.
In Add-on mode the 'images' folder should be referenced in the Add-on preferences.

Q: I still don't see any numbers on the cubes.
A: Check Viewport Shading in Blender.

At least 'Material Preview' should be enabled

Q: I don't see any game options in blender.
A: In blender workspace 'Layout' press 'N'.
You will get the 'Toolbox' right.
Find game controllers in the 'Sudocube' tab.
